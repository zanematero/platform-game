  "description": "In this game you will be a user controlled dinosaur! You will be able to use the arrow keys to move left, right, and jump. The goal of this game is to collect all the food. Once you have done so, you will have won! However, be careful with your movement as there are many platforms to traverse and gaps to be fallen through. You will also need to keep an eye out for dangerous spikes! If you touch one of these, you will be forcefully reset from the beginning. Goodluck! (hint: to jump over spikes, jump straight up THEN once high enough, move right. You can do it!)",
